# Local continual context learning (development only)

This code is opt-in. An enabled `autoCycle` project can launch a detached,
one-shot local cycle at SessionStart; `liveSelection` can choose wiki cards
at recall. Neither is enabled by installing this development checkout alone.
These synthetic tests leave the operating QMD database, plugin configuration,
and global hooks unchanged. Use an owner-only absolute `state-dir` dedicated
to one project. Do not put that directory in the repository.

## Evidence and labels

`contextLearning.capture` records a bounded candidate pool only when enabled.
Candidate relevance labels (`necessary`, `supporting`, `irrelevant`) and the
reviewed request-level 0–3 final-card selection are separate records. A model
prediction is never written as selection gold. `review-selection` requires the
captured input hash, reviewer ID and reference. `build-manifest` pins reviewed
pair labels, revisions and train/calibration/validation/evaluation family splits.
The local selection queue also requires an intact reviewed selection, every
candidate reviewed, complete captured input text, a complete returned pool for
v2/v3 samples, and current revision hashes. Deletion revokes dependent manifests
and removes local labels and request-linked teacher ledger entries; aggregate
project budget counters remain to prevent deleted calls from reopening spend.
Deletion does not unlearn weights.

The teacher-facing capture stores at most 2,000 prompt characters and 600
characters per candidate. For an eligible wiki card, those 600 characters are
from the **body after frontmatter**, so a long title or metadata cannot consume
the body budget. Separately, the exact complete compact body is pinned in the
private `compact_inputs` table with the source-file and body SHA-256 values.
Its hard limit is 16 KiB of body and 64 KiB of source-file bytes. The body is
never silently truncated: missing, malformed or oversized snapshots exclude
the request from local training. A 600-character lead is an authoring guideline
for immediate hook context, not an arbitrary Laya input cutoff. Local training
uses the complete compact body when available; the explicit `inspect-labels`
review view exposes that same pinned body to a local reviewer. Long original novel manuscripts
are still unsupported; they need a separate full-source contract. The Laya
0.3.20 adapter tokenizes the exact prompt and full compact body, checks both
option markers and the complete state token IDs, and rejects a case if the
model's configured sequence budget cannot hold it. The Mini's multilingual
checkpoint declares `max_len=1024` even though its tokenizer advertises 8192;
the adapter uses the **model's 1024-token budget**. Thus 16 KiB is a storage
ceiling, not a guarantee that every body fits Laya. There is no silent
truncation. `laya_raw.py` is a separate raw-data adapter with an assumed 0.3.23
candidate pin, not this verified 0.3.20 integration.

## One local cycle

`run-local-cycle` accepts an immutable manifest version, a private revisions
JSON file, a private trainer argv JSON file, and an owner-only incumbent artifact.
The fixed local executable receives `train` with only reviewed train cases, or
`predict` with unlabeled validation/evaluation cases. It writes one opaque
artifact file and bounded JSON predictions. The parent monitors wall time and
sampled process-group RSS, caps row/file sizes, strips credentials and proxy environment
variables, and requests offline Hugging Face/Transformers mode. The executable
must itself be trusted local code; these environment variables are not an OS
network sandbox. Only one cycle holds the state lock. A repeated cycle ID
returns its recorded verdict, and interrupted local training can resume from
the queued phase. Changed source revisions or labels reject the cycle.

The first 100 reviewed questions are the minimum train count. Validation and
independent evaluation each need at least 50 questions, 10 reviewed `none`
questions and 5 families. Validation compares challenger and incumbent on the
same questions. Promotion requires exact selection improvement without a drop
in necessary-card recall or `none` success, and without an increase in
irrelevant-card injection. Evaluation is reported after the decision and is
not used to select the checkpoint. Reusing those questions across cycles
makes later reports exploratory rather than a fresh independent estimate.
Promotion atomically changes only the
private `active-checkpoint.json` pointer. `rollback-local-checkpoint` restores
its previous artifact pointer; no weights are deleted.

`run-due-cycle` is a schedule gate, not a daemon. The 95%
goal adjusts the **interval between learning cycles**. The interval is 24 hours
to 14 days, can at most double or halve per assessment, and shortens on weak
recent incumbent validation quality, new families, source churn or recent
failure. It needs at least 50 validation questions including 10 `none` cases
and five families before extending. For pacing, it divides the observed Wilson
lower bound by the best attainable bound at the same sample count and caps
that ratio by exact accuracy. A score near 95% extends smoothly; at 95% it
doubles the interval. This normalized signal is not a claim that true accuracy
exceeds 95%, and it never activates a model. Insufficient evidence cannot
extend the interval.

## Current corpus and live selection

Each opt-in capture records a SHA-256 fingerprint of active QMD document
paths/hashes and search configuration when that snapshot is available.
Changing the active corpus or index configuration creates a new immutable
snapshot and queues old candidate pools for review; it does not rewrite old
samples. Automatic cycles default to `dataMode: current` and refuse an
evaluation manifest containing older or unavailable corpus fingerprints.
`historical_snapshot` must be chosen explicitly for frozen-snapshot work.
Re-search, whole-body review, and approval of replacement labels remain human
steps. Capture or an attempted current auto cycle performs reconciliation;
there is no continuous corpus watcher.

`contextLearning.liveSelection: true` changes the primary QMD request cap to
15. After source freshness and eligibility checks, the local Laya adapter sees
each candidate's complete compact wiki body and returns 0–3 card IDs. The
hook logs hashed candidate and selected IDs, snapshot fingerprint, fallback
reason and observed time/RSS. Missing state, invalid model output, changed
checkpoint or runtime failure restores the ordinary bounded QMD choice.
`live-selector.json` and an active local checkpoint are separately required;
this development checkout does not install either in an operating project.

## Optional external teacher

No teacher call occurs during capture, local cycles or the schedule gate.
`budgeted-label-request` and `budgeted-second-opinion` require an explicit
private policy with project ID, host, exact request IDs, separate creation and
review models, maximum calls, bytes per call, total bytes and a conservative
USD reservation per call. The project ID binds to the private state root.
Attempt IDs prevent duplicate paid calls; retries need a new ID and consume a
new reservation. Provider billing cannot be hard-capped by this local ledger;
the configured USD reservation is an upper-bound assumption supplied by the
operator. Second opinions are advisory and never become reviewed gold.

## Verification

`test/context-learning-cycle.test.mjs` runs synthetic selection-gold,
cadence/promotion, teacher-budget and 200-question end-to-end fixtures.
The mock trainer fails once, resumes, compares on validation, reports separate
evaluation, promotes, rolls back, and rejects a stale source. No private data,
Laya runtime, external model or operating QMD state is used by these tests.
`test/context-learning-real-laya.test.mjs` is opt-in and runs the actual Mini
Laya runtime and local multilingual checkpoint on synthetic cards only. It
exercises runtime attestation, train/predict protocol, a head-only update,
private temporary checkpoint save/reload and a >600-byte complete body.

## Real Laya 0.3.20 adapter

The Mini has a separate existing runtime at
`~/work/local-llm/data/decision-eval/envs/laya/bin/python` (Python 3.12.14,
Laya 0.3.20, Torch 2.14.0). Its editable Laya source is at
`~/work/local-llm/data/decision-eval/repos/laya` commit `23a1752`, and the
existing multilingual checkpoint is under
`~/work/local-llm/data/decision-eval/hf/hub/models--convaiinnovations--laya`.
This is distinct from an iCloud `laya-runtime/.venv` whose `bin/python`
points to a removed pyenv 3.12.6 interpreter. Do not repair that old link or
copy the old environment. Past Mini reports identify Laya 0.3.20 and MPS but
do not record the exact Python executable for each run.

`core/context_learning/laya_adapter.py` implements the trusted local
`train`/`predict` executable. The `LocalTrainer` command prefix is the
absolute Mini Python path, the absolute adapter path, then the absolute
multilingual checkpoint directory. It reads Laya's local tokenizer, config
and safetensors directly; it does not call `laya.Agent`, whose tokenizer repair
may write inside a shared model snapshot. A SHA-256 bundle identity covers
model weights, Laya config, encoder config and tokenizer files. Training
validates every exact input before any update, freezes the encoder and uses
only reviewed train choices for a head-only SGD epoch. A single safetensors
artifact holds the changed head and pinned base/policy identity. Prediction
loads the base plus that head, rejects held-out gold fields and returns 0–3
candidate IDs using the frozen `p>=0.5`, score-ranked policy. A private base
manifest may reference the unchanged checkpoint without copying its weights;
`prepare-local-laya-base` creates that owner-only artifact for an explicit
state directory. The threshold is not claimed to be calibrated for wiki
selection: held-out validation decides whether a trained head is promoted.
The one-update synthetic MPS smoke saved a 59,880,984-byte head artifact,
reloaded it into a fresh model and compared its logits. No private novel
training or new external model call was part of that check.

## Runtime ownership and installation gate

`runtime_setup.py` provides read-only discovery, an installation plan, a real
synthetic compatibility proof and an explicit runtime-selection gate. Importing
it does not download Python, install packages or change an active runtime.
The default selection mode is a plugin-owned generation under
`~/Library/Application Support/qmd-auto-context/runtimes/laya` on macOS. A
managed interpreter must resolve inside that owner-only root and match the
pinned Python 3.12.14 and package versions. An existing interpreter may be
reused only with an explicit path and an attestation bound to the interpreter,
base-model and adapter hashes. That attestation must record successful
synthetic compact-wiki tokenization without truncation, inference, one-step
training, checkpoint reload and fixed selection mapping. `attest_runtime()`
now generates that proof by running the real local synthetic smoke; it hashes
the adapter and base bundle before and after. The Mini runtime passed and can
be explicitly selected for a local cycle with that proof. This did not
activate a project, a global hook or a background worker.

`runtime_installer.py` now contains the explicit managed staging, activation
and rollback functions. Staging requires a SHA-pinned uv 0.12.20 executable
and a complete hash-locked PyPI requirements file. It installs Python 3.12.14
inside a new owner-only generation with no global executable link, creates a
venv whose interpreter resolves inside that generation, syncs only hashed
wheels using a private cache and checks the exact managed package versions.
Activation runs the real synthetic proof before atomically changing the
owner-only active pointer. The pointer records the runtime, adapter and model
hashes; a later managed selection rechecks them. Rollback rechecks the previous
generation and restores the pointer. Old generations are kept, never updated
in place. Base-model cache reuse is read-only and requires verified hashes;
mutable trained checkpoints belong to private per-project state. The proposed
sources are Astral uv's managed Python distribution and `laya==0.3.20` from
PyPI; `managed_install_plan()` records the proposed exact dependency pins.
Managed stage/activate/rollback was tested with a fake uv runner. On the Mac
mini, the official uv 0.12.20 executable was hash-checked and reused, then a
new inactive owner-only generation was actually installed with managed Python
3.12.14 and 35 SHA-256 locked PyPI packages. The lock is
`core/context_learning/locks/laya-macos-arm64-py312.lock` (SHA-256
`354c3c985a390d5045019e98871cc8a223237f25d891f36525e49f9a42e46447`).
The installed generation is under `~/Library/Application Support/qmd-auto-context/runtimes/laya/generations/g-7687971256c743dd88b286718ea8195f`.
The real local synthetic MPS smoke and trainer protocol passed. No Laya
`active.json`, project selector, or plugin/hook activation followed. The
installed wheels were fetched with `uv pip sync --require-hashes --no-build`
against `https://pypi.org/simple`; this is an observed Mini installation, not
a claim about every target platform or a production upgrade.
