"""Shared fail-safe entrypoint wrapper for hook scripts.

Hooks MUST always exit 0 — a policy "deny"/block decision is expressed as
JSON on stdout, never as a non-zero exit. Any uncaught exception reaching
the process top level turns into a non-zero exit, which the host
(Claude Code / Codex / Hermes / Antigravity) surfaces to the user as a
noisy "hook (failed): exited with code 1".

This is the single fail-open boundary for every Python hook entrypoint:
run `main()`, and on ANY exception return 0 so the hook degrades to a
silent no-op instead of a visible failure. The exception is best-effort
recorded to QMD_RECALL_LOG (file only, never stdout, so it can't pollute
the model context) when that env var is set — preserving the documented
diagnosis path (see CLAUDE.md "빈 출력은 정상 동작일 수 있다").

Rationale for centralizing here rather than per-site try/except: several
entrypoints (recall/posttool/gate/index/compile) call the same config and
filesystem helpers with no guard of their own, and a sandboxed runtime
(e.g. Codex seatbelt workspace-write) can deny filesystem access outside
its allowed roots and raise where an unsandboxed shell would not. Guarding
each call site is easy to miss on the next edit; one wrapper is not.

    """Run main() and ALWAYS return 0.

    main()'s return value is intentionally discarded: every qmd hook main()
    returns 0 on success, and the invariant is that the hook process exits 0
    regardless of what main() returns or raises. We coerce EVERYTHING to 0 --
    a non-zero/negative int return, or ANY exception including a SystemExit
    raised deep in a call tree or a KeyboardInterrupt -- so the hook can never
    surface as "hook (failed): exited with code N" to the host. A deny/block
    decision must be expressed as JSON on stdout, never via exit code. The
    exception (if any) is best-effort logged to QMD_RECALL_LOG.
